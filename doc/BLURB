GSK is a portable framework for writing flexible servers
and clients in C.  It includes builtin support for HTTP
and DNS as well as base 64, hashing functions, lowlevel
network information (like ifconfig), efficient buffering,
abstract socket i/o, and abstract datagram sockets.

It also can use several different polling mechanisms:
BSD's kqueue() and Solaris's /dev/poll, for efficiency,
as well as select() and poll() for portability.

It uses the glib 2.0.  You must have the development
packages, either -dev on debian or -devel on redhat, or a
"from source" install.
