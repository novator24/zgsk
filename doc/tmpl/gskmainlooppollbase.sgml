<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
GskMainLoopPollBase

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
a base class for file-descriptor-only polling mechanisms.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
This class converts signals and child-process-termination notification
events into I/O events so that derived class
need only implement I/O.  The remaining event types
are implemented in terms of pipes.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GskMainLoopPollBaseClass ##### -->
<para>
Base-class for I/O-only main-loops.
The @config_fd and @do_polling functions are to be implemented
by specific polling mechanisms.
</para>

@main_loop_class: the base-class from which this is derived.
@config_fd: method to change our preferences with regard to a file-descriptor.
These should not be cached, since the parent-class automatically coagulates
multiple configurations into a single event.  (Furthermore,
caching would break on some OS's where the file-descriptor
is auto-unpolled when it is closed.)
@do_polling: 

<!-- ##### STRUCT GskMainLoopPollBase ##### -->
