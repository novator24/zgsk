macro-based list macros

<para>
These macros define several kinds of "invasive" list
structures.  We call them invasive because their
members must be placed in structures which
you are in charge of allocating: for example, if you are
using a doubly-linked list, you must place two link pointers in
your structures.
</para>
<para>
Perhaps an example will help to illustrate:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
typedef struct _IntNode IntNode;
struct _IntNode
{
  int value;
  IntNode *prev, *next;
};
IntNode *first_int = NULL, *last_int = NULL;
]]>&hash;<![CDATA[define GET_INT_LIST]]><![CDATA[() IntNode *, first_int, last_int, prev, next

  IntNode *add = g_new (IntNode, 1);
  add->a = 42;
  GSK_LIST_APPEND (GET_INT_LIST]]><![CDATA[(), add);
]]></programlisting>
In other words, your "list" is just the presence of the members
"prev", "next", "first_int", "last_int" and the macro
definition "GET_INT_LIST()".
</para>
<para>You might see why this is useful immediately,
but here's a few neat implications of
a macro-based system:
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem><para>they are as fast as writing the list code yourself.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem><para>they allow you to manage memory as you want.</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem><para>it is easy to have the nodes be members of several
 lists, or other invasive data structures</para>
 </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
 Here are the types of lists, along with some examples:
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>stack</term>
   <listitem><para>
   A stack is a singly-linked list where we only keep
   track of one end.
   </para>
   <para>
   To define a stack, you should make a macro
   defining the type of node, the end-pointer, and the member-name.
   </para>
   <para>Here is a stack:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
typedef struct _StackNode StackNode;
struct _StackNode
{
  int value;
  StackNode *next;
};
StackNode *stack_top = NULL;
]]>&hash;<![CDATA[define GET_STACK]]><![CDATA[()  StackNode *, stack_top, next
    ]]></programlisting>
   </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>queue</term>
   <listitem><para>
   A queue is a singly-linked list where we keep
   track of both ends.
   </para>
   <para>
   To define a queue, you should make a macro
   defining the type of node, the first and last pointers,
   and the member-name.
   </para>
   <para>Here is a queue:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
typedef struct _QueueNode QueueNode;
struct _QueueNode
{
  int value;
  QueueNode *next;
};
QueueNode *head = NULL, *tail = NULL;
]]>&hash;<![CDATA[define GET_QUEUE]]><![CDATA[()  QueueNode *, head, tail, next
    ]]></programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>This defines a queue such that "prepending" to the queue
   means inserting an element at its "head" end.
   To put an element at the tail end, use "enqueue",
   and to remove from the head end, use "dequeue".
   It is not possible to remove from the tail end.
   </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>list</term>
   <listitem><para>
   A list is a doubly-linked list where we keep
   track of both ends.
   </para>
   <para>
   To define a list, you should make a macro
   defining the type of node, the first and last pointers,
   and the names of the members corresponding to
   the previous and next pointers.
   </para>
   <para>Here is a list:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
typedef struct _ListNode ListNode;
struct _ListNode
{
  int value;
  ListNode *prev, *next;
};
ListNode *head = NULL, *tail = NULL;
]]>&hash;<![CDATA[define GET_LIST]]><![CDATA[()  ListNode *, head, tail, prev, next
    ]]></programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>This defines a list such that "prepending"
   means inserting an element at its "head" end,
   and "appending" means inserting an element at its "tail" end.
   Similarly "remove_first" will remove the head element
   and "remove_last" will remove the tail element.
   And, since this is a doubly-linked list, you can also
   remove an arbitrary element.
   </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
</para>

<para>
The sorting routines
all take "comparator macros".
These take three arguments: two nodes and a variable
which should be set to -1, 0, or +1 if the first
node is less than, equal to, or greater than
the second node.
</para>
<para>
For the list example, here's a comparator macro:
<programlisting>&hash;define COMPARATOR<![CDATA[]]>(a,b,rv) \
<![CDATA[
  rv = (a->value < b->value) ? -1 : (a->value > b->value) ? 1 : 0
]]></programlisting>
