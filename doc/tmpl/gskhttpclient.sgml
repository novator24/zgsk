<!-- ##### STRUCT GskHttpClientRequest ##### -->
<para>
An opaque object representing a request that may be made
to the HTTP server.
</para>


<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GskHttpClientResponse ##### -->
<para>
A callback to handle the response from the server.
(The response content actually streams back -- at this
point we may have merely have gotten the header.)
</para>

@request: the #GskHttpRequest initially sent by the client.
@response: the #GskHttpResponse parsed from the server.
@input: a #GskStream which is the content, if any.
@hook_data: the argument to gsk_http_client_request().


<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GskHttpClientTrap ##### -->
<para>
Notification that the client is ready to take another HTTP request.
</para>

@client: the ready GskHttpClient
@data: data passed to gsk_http_client_trap_requestable()
@Returns: whether to keep getting new notifications.


<!-- ##### STRUCT GskHttpClientClass ##### -->
<para>Class of the HTTP client stream.
Not broadly useful.</para>

@stream_class: the base stream.
@set_poll_requestable: function called by the hook
to change whether the HTTP client trap should be triggered.
@shutdown_requestable: function called by the hook
to stop being able to accept new requests.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GskHttpClient ##### -->
<para>
A stream which is the client side of an HTTP connection.

<!-- ##### MACRO GSK_HTTP_CLIENT_DEFERRED_SHUTDOWN ##### -->

</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO GSK_HTTP_CLIENT_HOOK ##### -->
<para>
Obtain the hook which is triggered by
new ability to make a new request.
</para>
<para>
Mostly private.
</para>

@client: the client whose hook should be returned.

</para>

@client: 


<!-- ##### MACRO gsk_http_client_trap_requestable ##### -->
<para>
Trap the event that the HTTP client is ready for
another request to be issued.
</para>
<para>
If this is set to do "fast notify" (see GSK_HTTP_CLIENT_IS_FAST()), then
this hook will be triggered nearly continuously.
</para>

@client: the HTTP client to watch.
@func: the callback for when a header is ready.
@shutdown: function called when no further requests can be made.
@data: data to pass to @func and @shutdown.
@destroy: function to call when the trap is removed.


<!-- ##### MACRO gsk_http_client_untrap_requestable ##### -->
<para>
Untrap the event that the HTTP client is ready for
another request to be issued.
</para>

@client: the HTTP client to stop watching.


<!-- ##### MACRO gsk_http_client_is_requestable ##### -->
<para>
Get whether the HTTP client is able to handle another
request. 
</para>
<para>
Or at least, whether it thinks it is able
to handle another request.  The server may elect to set Connection: close
and then further requests will never be processed.
</para>

@client: the client to query.
