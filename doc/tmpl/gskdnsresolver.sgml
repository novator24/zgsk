gskdnsresolver

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
An interface that DNS resolvers provide.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>

@base_iface: 
@resolve: begin a name-resolution task.  The pointer returned
should identify the task to the resolver object,
so that it can be cancelled.  Alternatively, if 
the resolver can operate without blocking, it may return NULL,
after having called the success or failure callback.
@cancel: a method to cancel a still running DNS task.
