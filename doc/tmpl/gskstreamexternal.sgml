<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GskStreamExternalTerminated ##### -->
<para>
Function to run when the process underlying the stream is terminated.
</para>

@external: the stream corresponding to the process.
@wait_info: information about why the process exited.
@user_data: passed in from gsk_stream_external_new().


<!-- ##### USER_FUNCTION GskStreamExternalStderr ##### -->
<para>
Function to be run with single lines taken from standard-error
of the subprocess.  The line has had the newline chopped from it.
</para>

@external: the stream corresponding to the process.
@error_text: the NUL-terminated text from the subprocess.
@user_data: passed in from gsk_stream_external_new().

@read_buffer: data pending read from child.
@max_read_buffer: max bytes data pending read from child.
@read_err_fd: file-descriptor to read from (sent as 
standard-error of the child process).
@read_err_source: notification that the error stream is ready-to-read.
@read_err_buffer: data pending from error stream.
@max_err_line_length: maximum length of line for an error string.
@process_source: process-termination notification.
@pid: process id.
@term_func: function to call when the child process dies.
@err_func: function to call with standard error data.
@user_data: parameter to pass to @term_func and @err_func.
