<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Obtain information about your local network interfaces.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
These methods allow you to obtain information about the
local network interfaces.
</para>
<para>
A network interface is abstract jargon for an ethernet card,
that is, it's a device that transmits and receives packets.
Or, it can be a virtual interface, like the loopback interface is.
One other possibility is that the interface is an alias:
this sort of trick is done to make a computer listen
on two IP addresses.
</para>
<para>
The information returned by this function is a name
for each interface (the same name as returned by <command>ifconfig</command>)
and addresses, mostly the address used to connect to this device,
ie your IP address (with port set to 0).

<!-- ##### STRUCT GskNetworkInterface ##### -->
<para>
Information about a single network interface.
</para>

@ifname: the name of the interface.
@address: the IP address of the interface (with port set to 0).
@hw_address: the ethernet address of the interface.
@p2p_address: the remote IP address of a point-to-point connection.
@broadcast: the broadcast IP address.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GskNetworkInterfaceSet ##### -->
<para>
Information about a number of network interfaces.
</para>

@num_interfaces: the number of interfaces.
@interfaces: the interfaces.

<!-- ##### ENUM GskNetworkInterfaceFlags ##### -->
<para>
Constraints governing which interfaces to return.
</para>

@GSK_NETWORK_INTERFACE_UP: The interface must be up, ready to transmit
and receive packets.
@GSK_NETWORK_INTERFACE_LOOPBACK: The interface must be a loopback interface,
a virtual interface, as opposed to a piece of hardware.
@GSK_NETWORK_INTERFACE_NON_LOOPBACK: The interface must be a non-loopback interface,
an actual piece of hardware.
@GSK_NETWORK_INTERFACE_HAS_BROADCAST: The interface must have a broadcast address.
@GSK_NETWORK_INTERFACE_HAS_MULTICAST: The interface must have a multicast support.
