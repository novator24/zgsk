GSK -- a library for writing servers.

It facilitates writing very efficient single-threaded
servers in C.  It has facilities which directly support
some standard protocols, as well as some simple main-loop and
parser abstractions.

It is licensed under the LGPL, to give you the maximum freedom
in writing your application.

--

In order to compile or use GSK, you must have Glib 2.0 installed.
If you are using a standard linux distribution, a package is
probably available.  Otherwise, the source is available at
ftp://ftp.gtk.org/.

If you have received a distributed .tar.gz file, please
read INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
